**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


## Milestone 3 Team Feedback Revisions

No revision since we haven't got mielstone 3 feedback yet.


## Collective Implementation
> Explain how your team **collectively** implemented sessions and user access controls. (1-2 sentences)

We went over example code in class and tried to understand it. Then we coded on one person's laptop and went to office hour together.
