# Asain Market Website
Developed a website for an Asian market. The main programming languages used were PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SQL. The site not only allowed customers to log in and view and filter for desired items, but also allowed the administrator to manage the web page and add or remove new items from the database.
